## Introduction  

This project explores whether national flags ‚Äî through their colors, symbols, and patterns ‚Äî may reflect deeper elements of a country, such as its **happiness, economy, and social support**.  

As someone interested in **social sciences and cultural studies**, I have always been fascinated by how symbols represent societies. Flags are important national symbols, but do they tell us something meaningful about a country's well-being? Through this project, I aim to investigate the **relationship between flag designs and real-world indicators like happiness scores and GDP**.  

In the updated version, I applied **machine learning models** to see whether flag features can predict happiness scores and selected specific test cases to evaluate prediction quality.

## Motivation   

National flags are more than just beautiful pieces of cloth ‚Äî they represent a country's identity, history, culture, and beliefs. As a person who has always been curious about **how culture connects to society's well-being**, I wanted to address this topic from a **data science perspective**.  

Some questions I am curious to explore:  
- Are countries with **blue flags** happier on average?  
- Do **religious symbols** in flags reflect differences in GDP or happiness?  
- Are there visible patterns in flag designs based on **geographic regions or economic status**?  

Although there are studies about the cultural and political meaning of flags, **there is little to no data-driven research** into how flag aspects link to social variables such as happiness. That makes this a **creative and original** project combining data science with social science.

## Data Merging Plan  

Steps:  
1. **Standardized country names** by stripping whitespaces and lowering case.  
2. **Merged datasets** based on country names.  
3. Selected countries with happiness score and valid flag feature data.  
4. Handled `;`-delimited flags.csv and cleaned column names for consistency.

## Data Analysis

### 1. Data Cleaning  
- Fixed mismatches between country names (e.g., "USA" vs "United States").
- Selected relevant features such as flag color/symbol counts and happiness score.
- Ensured proper encoding and handling of numeric/categorical features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Histogram of Happiness Scores**: Displayed normal-like distribution.
- **Top 15 Happiest Countries**: Visualized with horizontal bar chart.
- **Boxplot by Region**: Showed regional happiness variations.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Explored inter-variable relations.
- **Freedom vs Happiness Scatterplot**: Showed clear positive correlation.

### Correlation Heatmap

### 3. Hypothesis Testing: Freedom vs Happiness
- **Null Hypothesis**: Freedom and Happiness are not correlated.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: There is a positive correlation.
- **Test**: Pearson Correlation Coefficient
  - r = 0.6429
  - p < 0.0001
- **Conclusion**: Reject null. Freedom positively correlates with Happiness.

## Machine Learning Model

### Objective
To predict a country's happiness score based on flag features (colors and symbols).

### Hypothesis
> **"A country's flag design may contain patterns (colors/symbols) that relate to its happiness level."**

### Model Used
- **Random Forest Regressor** from scikit-learn
- 80/20 Train-Test Split
- Features used: red, green, blue, gold, white, black, orange, crosses, crescents, sunstars, icon presence, etc.

### Results
- **R¬≤ Score**: 0.076 (Low predictive power)
- **MSE**: 1.46
- This suggests that **flag designs alone are not strong predictors** of happiness.

### Sample Predictions
| Country   | Actual Happiness | Predicted | Error |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|-------|
| Greece    | 4.86             | 7.38      | 2.52  |
| Brazil    | 6.98             | 4.92      | 2.06  |
| Singapore | 6.80             | 5.01      | 1.79  |

## Possible Challenges  

| Challenge                              | Solution                                  |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Country name mismatches                | Normalization and manual corrections      |
| Dataset size differences               | Focused on common countries               |
| Flags contain categorical/symbol data  | Binary encoding used                      |
| Low correlation between flags and happiness | Highlighted in results and future work |

---

## Future Work  

- Add **Human Development Index** and **Democracy Index** to improve predictions
- Investigate deeper meaning of **flag color psychology**
- Analyze **flag changes over time** and link to historical happiness shifts
- Explore **regional case studies** with cultural/political backgrounds
- Use **textual/visual analysis** of flag images for more nuanced features

## Data Analysis & EDA

After cleaning, standardizing country names, and merging the datasets (104 common countries), we perform exploratory visualizations:

## Hypothesis Testing (General)

Test whether any flag feature correlates with happiness:

```python
from scipy.stats import pearsonr
for feat in feature_cols:
    r, p = pearsonr(merged_df[feat], merged_df['Happiness Score'])
    print(f"{feat:10s} ‚Üí r = {r:.2f}, p = {p:.4f}")
```

* **Economy (GDP per Capita)**: r = +0.79, p < 0.0001
* **Family**: r = +0.76, p < 0.0001
* **Health (Life Expectancy)**: r = +0.74, p < 0.0001
* **Freedom**: r = +0.64, p < 0.0001
* Other flag features (colors/symbols) show weak or non-significant correlations (p > 0.05)

**Conclusion:** Reject H‚ÇÄ for socio-economic indicators. Flag‚Äêspecific features alone do not significantly correlate with happiness.

---

## Machine Learning Model

Convert continuous scores into binary labels around the median (\~5.12):

```python
median_score = merged_df['Happiness Score'].median()
merged_df['Happiness_Level'] = merged_df['Happiness Score'] \
    .apply(lambda x: 'high' if x >= median_score else 'low')
```

Train a **Random Forest Classifier** on 14 flag attributes:

```python
feature_cols = [
  'green','blue','gold','white','black',
  'circles','crosses','saltires','quarters',
  'sunstars','crescent','triangle','icon','animate'
]
X = merged_df[feature_cols]
y = merged_df['Happiness_Level']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
  X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

---

## Results & Evaluation

```python
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))

cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
print("5-Fold CV Accuracy Scores:", cv_scores)
print("Mean CV Accuracy:", cv_scores.mean())
```

| Metric                  | Value |
| ----------------------- | ----- |
| Test Accuracy           | 0.57  |
| Mean 5-Fold CV Accuracy | 0.62  |

**Confusion Matrix** (true ‚Üì / pred ‚Üí):

```
       low  high
low      7     3
high     4     7
```

---

## Challenges

* **Weak signal**: Flag features alone poorly predict happiness class.
* **Binary binning**: Reduces nuance in continuous scores.
* **Sample size**: Only \~100 countries after merging.

---

## Future Work

* Experiment with **multi-class** labels (low/medium/high).
* Test other classifiers (SVM, XGBoost) and tune hyperparameters.
* Incorporate additional national indicators (HDI, Democracy Index).
* Explore **feature importance** and SHAP values for interpretability.
* Analyze **historical flag evolutions** vs. longitudinal happiness trends.
